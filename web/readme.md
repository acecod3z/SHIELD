# SHIELD Web Interface

## 🛡️ Overview

SHIELD Web Interface is an intelligent security analysis platform that leverages AI to detect malicious inputs across multiple data formats. This web application serves as the front-end interface for real-time threat detection and analysis.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

The SHIELD Web Interface provides a user-friendly way to analyze various types of inputs for potential security threats. It uses machine learning models trained on extensive datasets to identify malicious patterns in user-submitted data.

---

## 📋 Features

### Current Implementation

The web interface includes **three distinct input fields** designed to handle different data formats:

#### 1. **Text Input Field**
- Accepts plain text and string-based inputs
- Analyzes for SQL injection patterns, XSS attacks, command injection, and other text-based threats
- Validates against known malicious patterns and obfuscation techniques

#### 2. **URL Input Field**
- Accepts URL and web address inputs
- Detects malicious URLs, phishing attempts, redirect attacks, and SSRF vulnerabilities
- Validates URL structure and checks for suspicious patterns

#### 3. **Image Input Field**
- Accepts image files (JPG, PNG, GIF, etc.)
- Analyzes image metadata and embedded content
- Detects steganography, malicious payloads, and suspicious file structures

## 🤖 AI-Powered Analysis

### How It Works

When a user submits data through any of the three input fields:

1. **Data Collection**: The input is captured and prepared for analysis
2. **AI Model Processing**: The data is sent to our trained AI model (to be integrated)
3. **Threat Classification**: The model analyzes and classifies the input as:
   - **Benign** (Safe)
   - **Malicious** (Threat detected)

### Analysis Results

#### ✅ If Input is Benign:
- A clean report is generated showing:
  - The submitted input
  - Confirmation of safety status
  - Timestamp of analysis
  - Input type and format

#### ⚠️ If Input is Malicious:
- A detailed threat report is generated showing:
  - The exact malicious query/input entered
  - **Attack classification** (e.g., SQL Injection, XSS, CSRF, etc.)
  - **Attack type category** from our trained model
  - Severity level
  - Recommended mitigation actions

## 🔮 Future Features (Planned Integration)

### Phase 1: AI Model Integration
**Status:** Pending upload by team member

Once the AI model is uploaded to the repository, it will be integrated to:
- Provide real-time analysis of all three input types
- Classify attacks into specific categories (50+ attack types supported)
- Display confidence scores for threat detection
- Show MITRE ATT&CK technique mappings

### Phase 2: Honeypot Integration
**Status:** Development planned

After successful AI model integration, a sophisticated honeypot system will be deployed:

#### 🍯 Honeypot Mechanism

When malicious input is detected:

1. **Deception Layer Activation**: Instead of blocking the attacker immediately, the system engages them
2. **Fake Terminal Access**: The attacker is presented with what appears to be a backend terminal or system shell
3. **GPT-Powered Interaction**: Behind the scenes, attacker commands are intercepted and handled by a GPT wrapper
4. **Realistic Responses**: The AI generates believable system responses to maintain the illusion of access
5. **Intelligence Gathering**: All attacker actions, commands, and techniques are logged for analysis
6. **Safe Containment**: The attacker never actually accesses real systems or data

#### Benefits of Honeypot System:
- **Threat Intelligence**: Collect real-world attack methodologies
- **Attacker Profiling**: Understand attacker behavior and techniques
- **Time Delay**: Keep attackers occupied while security team responds
- **Training Data**: Generate new attack samples for model improvement
- **Zero Risk**: Attackers interact with simulated environment only
